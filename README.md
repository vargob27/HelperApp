# HelperApp
## Features:
Request a helper for yourself or friend/family  

Set a time and date in the future for a service  

Receive assistance from a helper to finish tasks that a user may not be able to do on their own such as changing a high reaching lightbulb or battery, assist in going to a doctor visit, go grocery shopping with them, and various other tasks.  

Select a specific helper that you enjoyed to build a lasting relationship with the client  

User can create and set tasks for the helper in advance to expedite their visit and save the user hours for future help.  


## MVP:
Implement outside API's to retrieve information such as available products at local stores  

Have reminders or notifications from the app to give useful information such as helper hours being expended or left over in between billing cycles.   

Ability to communicate with your helper in the app and give ratings for service received to better provide incentives for helpers to provide the best care they can.  


## Things to consider:
**Scheduling of helpers** - How can we make sure we always have enough helpers but also make it worth the helpers time to be available even when not being paid/providing service to a user  

**Providing Service** - Does the user request a specific amount of time or should it just be however long the helper is with the client is how their hours are deducted? What happens when a client expends all of their allotted hours for the month?  

**Capturing the Market** - How can we still look to provide services to our clients outside of their hourly help bank? Should we offer other specific services that are just a flat fee that gets added to their monthly bill?
